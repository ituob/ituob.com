          <li>
            If an edition comes with an Annexed List, instead of a single MS Word document,
            download an archive containing OB Edition and Annexed Publication as two separate
            MS Word documents.
          <li>
            Recent OB Editions come in .docx format, but older ones may come in .doc.
