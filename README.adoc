The website built from this source is available at:
* Production: https://www.ituob.org
* Staging: https://staging-www.ituob.org

Generates a web-based representation of individual OB issues
and message filtering across OB issues.

== Building

* Ensure you have Ruby and Git.
* Clone the repository & initialize submodules.
* Run `bundle`; then `bundle exec jekyll build` (or `serve`).

== Approach

Each ITU OB issue is modelled as a collection of messages.
Each section in an OB issue is considered a message.

== Authoring

* The link:https://github.com/ituob/itu-ob-editor/[ITU OB editor],
  currently in early alpha testing mode, will be the authoring tool
  for ITU Operational Bulletin data.

* See link:https://github.com/ituob/itu-ob-data/[itu-ob-data]
  for how the `data` directory should be structured.

== OB issues

Place each OB issue under `data/issues/{{ OB No. }}/` directory.

Each OB issue should contain the following files:

`meta.yaml`::
Information about OB issue: number, date, authors, etc.

`general.yaml`::
General information from the OB issue.
Contains a list of messages.

`amendments.yaml`::
The amendments part from the OB issue.
Contains a list of messages.

`annexes.yaml`::
Any annexes to this OB issue.

== Referenced service publications (annexed Lists)

Many messages in OB issue amend previous publications.

To avoid repeating publication titles and other metadata,
each publication is given an ID.

When a publication is annexed to an OB issue,
and whenever it is amended in subsequent issues,
its publication ID is referenced.

Place all publications under `data/lists/{{ list (publication) ID }}/`.

Each publication directory should contain one file:

`meta.yaml`::
Publication metadata, such as title, URL, associated recommendation.

When annexed to an OB issue, all Lists must specify a "`position`".
Amendments to such Lists should specify the position being amended as well.

(Technically this is redundant,
as we can infer the position being amended by finding which
position of the List was annexed to OB last,
but currently it is used for data consistency check.)

=== Special cases

Publications that are never annexed, but *are* amended
("`external`" Lists V and VIII, NNP dataset),
should also be included under `data/lists/`.
For them, amendments are not required to specify position.

Publications that are never amended, but *are* annexed
under section B of Annexed Lists in each OB edition
via `extra_links` array of `running_annexes` message
(e.g., BUREAUFAX, ROA),
should also be included under `data/lists/`.


== Documentation for site editors

Documentation for ITU OB authors, and also technically the same as editor app help,
is built from the `docs` Jekyll collection.

NOTE: This may be moved to a dedicated website in future.

These pages use docs[_*] layouts, and are styled by docs.scss.

Pages are generated twice, firstly (with default Jekyll behavior) as part of main website,
and secondly (with `builtin_app_help_generator.rb` plugin) to be used as applicationâ€™s built-in help.

=== Built-in app help page generation

The generator plugin is configured through `in_app_help` site-wide config key.
It re-uses the documents from specified collection under specified URL prefix,
specifying or overriding certain page frontmatter.

Most importantly, it sets the `{{ page.in_app_help }}` variable.

Site layouts make use of that variable to add a HTML class on `<body>`,
and to turn on/off (mostly off) certain UI elements that do not make sense
in context of built-in app help.

The https://github.com/ituob/itu-ob-editor[ITU OB editor] app loads these pages
when user uses the Help menu.


== Implementation details

The following plugins enable the site to function.

=== Issue data reader

Processes OB issue data and populates ``site.data``
with structured information
about OB issues and changes in telecommunications landscape covered by ITU

=== Issue page generator

Creates a page for each OB issue using ``site.data``

=== Message index generator

Generates message index/archive pages

=== Localizer

implements two template tags:

Template tag `{% trans a_string %}` allows to translate string variables specified
in the form of { <lang1>: <string1>, <lang2>: <string2> }.

Template tag `{% trans_file a_filename %}` includes file, specified by name relative
to current issue root, using language-specific version (<lang>-<a_filename>) if available.
It also parses AsciiDoc into HTML, so it does not belong under localizer umbrella per se.
